#Stock Analysis With VBA

##Purpose:
  This project looked at 2017 and 2018 stock data and analyze returns using VBA code to loop through the data for Steve. A refactored code was then introduced to see whether the time to execute and run the code was more efficient. Then, an analysis was done to discuss the pros and cons for code refactoring

##Results
-The stock performance in 2017 was superior to 2018 based on the analysis. Specifically, there was special attention given to "DQ" as it earned a return in 2017 of 199.4% vs a negative return in 2018 of - 62.6%. The refactored code ran at roughly .24 seconds and .26 seconds for 2018 and 2017 respectively using the refactored codes. The original codes yeilded .25 seconds and .26 seconds for 2018 and 2017 respectively
